# Xahau: Whitelist-Based Payment System

## Overview
This project implements a whitelist-based payment system where, for example, only students and faculty members can make payments to a designated address. The system utilizes Xahau Hooks to enforce transaction rules based on a whitelist and provides functionality for managing the whitelist.

## Key Features
1. **Whitelist Management**:
   - Add or remove wallet addresses from the whitelist. 
   - View the list of registered addresses.

2. **Enforcement of Transaction Rules**:
   - Only accounts registered in the whitelist can make payments to the designated address.
   - Payments from unauthorized accounts are rejected.

This system enables secure and restricted payment operations within a specific group of users.
